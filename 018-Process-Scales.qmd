# Process - Using Scales {#018-Process-Scales}

As discussed in 
[Tools - MIDI tools](#004-Tools-MIDI_tools)
, scale quantisation is a widely
used tool to harness the random note values from MIDI Generators. It
provides *just enough* quantising to turn something unlistenable into
something that's still random, but perhaps
more listenable. The problem is that even within a defined scale, there
are sometimes notes that will irritate the listener if they happen too
often - for example in the C Major scale, the note B - one semitone
below or 11 semitones above the root is always going to be a bit
jarring. In the context of most Western music that note is often played
in passing on the way back to the root note C. But in the context of
random note generators it may pop up a little too often for comfort and
not always resolve to the C. So what do we do? Avoid Major scales?

## Key idea

Finding a few useful scales that work well in a generative context is a
good idea. This is largely a matter of taste, and potentially just trial
and error to see what you like, but there are a few guiding principles
that might help inform your choice. Choosing scales or eliminating
*awkward* notes from a scale can also help make music where the tonal
centre of the music isn't locked in or ***obvious***, which allows you
to imply a change of key through a root note change, without having to
change the scale for the generated (or quantised) MIDI. I'll call this
being tonally ambiguous.

## Pentatonics - Minor and Major

You know how you can play only the black keys on the keyboard and no
matter what you play it just all somehow "fits" and sounds good? That's
because you are playing a pentatonic scale. Many guitarists will scoff
at players who riff away on a pentatonic scale, because it is seen as
being somehow a "cheat" and avoids having to learn more complex scales.
modes and harmonies. But for our generative purposes, ***pentatonic
scales are your absolute number 1 pick***. You can combine any number of
generative processes working within a pentatonic scale and they will fit
together like hand in glove.

Below are the notes and scale tones of the C pentatonic scales:

|                  |     |     |     |     |     |
|------------------|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| C min pentatonic |  C  | Eb  |  F  |  F  | Bb  |
| Scale tones      |  1  | m3  |  4  |  5  | b7  |

|                  |     |     |     |     |     |
|------------------|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| C Maj pentatonic |  C  |  D  |  E  |  G  |  A  |
| Scale tones      |  1  |  2  |  3  |  5  |  6  |

|                        |     |     |     |     |     |
|------------------------|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| C (neutral) pentatonic |  C  |  D  |  F  |  G  |  A  |
| Scale tones            |  1  |  2  |  4  |  5  |  6  |

If you pick any 3 out of either of these scales then you get nice triads
from their respective (non-pentatonic) scales.

## Hirajoshi

The Hirajoshi scale is a scale derived from Japanese shamisen music and the tuning of the koto instrument. It is a pentatonic scale, but with some interesting properties that distinguish it from the more frequently used versions above. It has the minor 3rd in it, which gives it a slightly melancholic feel, but also the minor 6th - C - G# (opening two notes from the theme from Star Trek).

|                        |     |     |     |     |     |
|------------------------|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| C Hirajoshi            |  C  |  D  |  D# |  G  |  G# |
| Scale tones            |  1  |  2  |  m3 |  5  |  m6 |


## Modes

Modal scales are ***hard*** to wrap your brain around at first. In
practice, they are very easy. Take the notes in the scale of C, start on
different note and end on the note one octave above that.

### Mixolydian mode

Start on the G of the C major scale and play only the "white keys" of
the C major scale up to the next G. That's the Mixolydian mode. Let's
look at the notes and scale tones and try to understand what's going on
though:

|              |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
|--------------|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| G Mixolydian |  G  |  A  |  B  |  C  |  D  |  E  |  F  |
| Scale tones  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  | b7  |
| C Mixolydian |  C  |  D  |  E  |  F  |  G  |  A  | Bb  |

Mixolydian is essentially a major scale but with a flattened 7th. This
is a nicer alternative to the straight major scale because the harsh
major 7th is "softened" by flattening it. You can combine this flattened
7th with other notes in the scale and get attractive chords. You can
also swap between the Mixolydian mode and the fourth of the natural
major key. So C Mixolydian has the same notes as F Major. G Mixolydian
has the same notes as C Major. If your MIDI note generator process pings
out the flattened seventh here, it won't sound harsh and abrasive. And
you could either play a root drone of the Mixolydian mode root, or the
fourth of the natural key and both would sound fine.

### Dorian mode

|             |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
|-------------|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| D Dorian    |  D  |  E  |  F  |  G  |  A  |  B  |  C  |
| Scale tones |  1  |  2  | b3  |  4  |  5  |  6  | b7  |
| C Dorian    |  C  |  D  | Eb  |  F  |  G  |  A  | Bb  |

Dorian is a more "minor" sounding mode (with a minor third from the
natural scale) and also the flattened 7th we talked about above. Dorian
is essentially the "minor" version of what we discussed above with the
Mixolydian, and it works for many of the same reasons.

## There are no "wrong" notes, only context

To paraphrase an old saying "Play a note once and it might be wrong.
Play it twice and it's jazz...". There is certainly a truth that there
are truly no "wrong notes" - whatever note you play you can add
additional notes around or resolve it to a point that it will work
within the context. When you compose or play with others, you can work
on the context or resolve these problematic notes towards something more
comfortable. This tension and release is a great feature of many tunes.
But within generative music, we can't guarantee that the processes we
have set up will provide that context or resolve the notes towards
something more pleasant.

If you are using generative processes to create something to play along
with - where ***you*** can provide the context and resolution, then go
ahead and try out other scales. In fact, this might be a really good
musical challenge... But this is a little beyond the scope of this book.
And my skill set.

## Selections of notes - chords

In 
[Recipe - Changing chords](#001-Recipe-Changing_Chords)
 and
[Process - Note-wise probability](#002-Process-Note_wise_probability)
 I talked about stacking notes in a
chord and then applying probability. I mentioned that you might want to
choose notes that would work well together, so that regardless of which
notes were chosen you would get something that didn't sound too "weird".
Now given the context of the scales above, I hope it will help point you
towards scale tones that would work over a selection of root notes, or
where a random selection of 3 or 4 (or 5 or 6!) of the notes would
produce something that would still be a "nice chord". Also
contextualising this collection of notes (chord!) with a given root note
or bass note for the chord would imply one key / mode or another.

## Other scales & traditions

In Western music we have a view of what collections of notes and pitches sound
"nice" or "harmonious" and, to our ears, what "works" and what "doesn't". Of
course, there is a huge world of scales in the world across a huge range of
musical traditions. In this chapter I've only focussed on some example scales.
With Ableton's Scale plugins and scale awareness you
might well find others where generative methods would give interesting results.
Within the DAW, experimenting with these scales is only a click away...
