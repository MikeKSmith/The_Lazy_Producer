# Process - Tuning Parameters {#008-Process-Tuning_Parameters}

This is actually a key concept, so ***DON'T SKIP THIS BIT***. It's the
difference between a random collection of sounds that wobble about randomly,
change notes randomly with very little coherence or musicality, or something
that's actually listenable and identifiable as music.

## Key idea

As with the advice to balance unexpected and predictable, the advice here is to
listen to the results of the generative processes and apply your musical ear
whether you feel it passes the test of being pleasant to listen to for extended
periods without any particular sound, pitch, volume or other modulated parameter
catching your ear.

## The Problem

We defined "generative" music in [What do we mean "Generative"
music?](0000-Defintion-Generative.qmd) . We defined it as "music (that) should
be able to go on indefinitely, with enough going on to make it interesting, but
without anything particularly "sticking out" to catch the listener's ear". When
we use random processes to generate notes, modulate parameters, change the
timbre and qualities of sounds, there's a danger that this randomness will
produce sounds that ***do*** "catch the listener's ear", or more than that -
***grate*** the listener's ear.

## The Taste Test

How to avoid this? Well, as chefs prepare dishes they continually taste and
adjust seasoning so that the end result is neither overly-seasoned nor
under-seasoned. Basically they taste and add salt throughout the process.
Similarly here, I suggest that you listen at each stage and adjust the amount of
randomness, the amount that modulation sources are changing parameters, and
whether there's too much unexpected stuff going on, or whether the track is too
static and doesn't change enough. While listening I find it best to try step
away from the Ableton Live session, or minimise the Live screen so that you can
concentrate on *listening* and not on what's happening within the Live set. Some
producers listen to their mixes from another room, or with the volume level low,
to see if anything "pops out" in the mix. I like listening to my generative
music while walking the dog. I make a mental note of anything that catches my
ear - but you can also note things down physically in a book or note for later.

## Waving, not droning

In the same way that waves on the ocean sometimes peak together to form very
large waves, it's possible for random processes to suddenly produce things that
don't sound right. And like the waves on the ocean it's sometimes difficult to
tell when this is going to happen. Also like waves on the ocean there may be 
periods where there is a lot going on and the track sounds "busy" as well as 
periods where there is less going on and the track sounds quiet and sparse. The
trick is to try to adjust modulation settings so there aren't too many "chaotic" 
periods nor periods where the track is static.

Consider changing the range that the modulation applies - making
the modulation more subtle - or changing the period of the random process. If
your LFOs are sine or triangle waves that have even number period (maximum
effect every 2, 4 or 8 bars) then eventually all of these will reach their peak
(or trough) together - after 8 bars - and this will keep happening every 8 bars.
Instead if the LFO period is a (large enough) prime number then the peak or
trough will take much longer to happen and may never repeat exactly the same.
Small amounts of modulations and uneven (and to be honest longer) modulation
periods will keep the movement happening in the music without it becoming
predictable. You can always use a modulation source to change the period or
amount of another modulation source.

## Be random, but not ***too*** random

Constraining randomness can be done up front in modulation - you can change the
upper and lower limits of the modulation - and you can apply constraints to MIDI
notes via Scale quantisation, you can have sequences that evolve randomly and so
over time transform themselves but in a way that isn't jarring. All of these are
ways to keep the randomness in check. As with the Taste Test (described above)
you should check in with what you're producing at each step to try to keep
unexpected and predictable in balance. This should keep your tracks from being
too much of one thing or the other.

## Tune the parameters

The amalgamation of all of these steps is to "tune" the random and other process
to find that sweet spot where things work together to produce something that you
and a future listener might enjoy listening too. As mentioned above, try to do
this throughout the process rather than just at the end. That way you can
balance as you go and achieve something that sounds good in its entirety rather
than a combination or collage of different ideas.
